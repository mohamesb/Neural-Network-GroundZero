# 🧠 Neural Network from Scratch (NumPy Only)

This project demonstrates how to build a simple feedforward neural network **from scratch** using only **NumPy**. It's designed to help beginners understand the core mechanics behind how neural networks work—without the complexity of deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

## 📘 About

- Implemented in a **Jupyter Notebook**.
- Uses **only NumPy**—no high-level machine learning libraries.
- Supports:
  - Hidden layers
  - Sigmoid activation
  - Basic forward and backward propagation
  - Training with gradient descent
- Tested on a Chest X-ray images of Pnuemonia positive and Covid-19 positive images dataset.

## 📁 Files

- `Short_notebook.ipynb`: The main notebook containing code, and training run.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You'll need Python and Jupyter Notebook. You can install the requirements using:

```bash
pip install notebook numpy
